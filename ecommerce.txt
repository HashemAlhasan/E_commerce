The reason for express.json middelware because need to acess the json files in our request body
we need to setup  the errors middelware under the get route to be the last one
also we 



why do we need express async errors?
because we will use async await in our controller 
so we need to use try and catch statmments for every fucntion 
so we use it insted of using try catch it will we applied to our controller automaticaaly 
why the order is important in error handlers in app.js' >
because once we hit the 404 we are not calling next     we see route does'nt exsist 
so express goes in all middelwareS
THEN EXPRESS TRIES TO HIT all the routes
after that it will automaticaaly end up in notfound
we are not calling next in 404 
we put the error handler last because of express rules
the error handler is invoked in the exsisting route

pacakge morgan
it is a package for logging 
meaning it always show which route is getting hit and the methode and t=if it its sucessful and the time spend 
we set it up  tiny in the deve;opemnt only
the enum proerty is to show the possible values 
we setup the validators usingn validate property in mongoose 
we have two proertys 
the validator which is a function  that validate the input 
the message proerty which is a message when it is not valid
we can setup the function maually 
or we can use npm paackage called validator 
it is just an altentive way to validate 
like we have matvh in jobs api 
we use the function keyword because in that way it will points to the user unlike the attow function

we will send the token using cookies
we can attach the cookies using res.cookies(name,value,options)
http only means the cokkie is only acessd by the web browser
how to acess cookie in server 
we have to install another package it is cookie parser
then we use it as middel ware to acess our cookie 
the browser wether its postam or anything else will automatically send that cookie 
we refactored our code by creating the attachcookies to response function which does all the work
first it create the token from the token user 
then it attach an cookie to the response 
we can send the response in the util
nut we will need to send the resopnse in multipel places so 
we put the esponse in our controolles
first the secure is like allows the browser to send cookies over https only
the singed option is to show if the cookies has been modified or not 
these two options are in the options of thoo cookies in the resopnse object 
we use secure cookies only if we were in production
we have to passs a the secret for jwt
